                Hey everyone, and welcome to my guide to Secrets of the Abyss. This game is the third game in the "Abyss" series,
                initially a spin-off from the much less popular sci-fi action game series "The Magenta Protocol".
                Unlike its predecessors, Secrets of the Abyss enjoyed only minor success overseas, perhaps due to its more complex systems and change in art style.
                Despite this, it is - in my opinion - one of the best JRPGs to come out of the 2000s!
                The systems can be tough to grapple with and are often unintuitive, which, combined with the very high overall difficulty,
                can get pretty frustrating - but once everything comes together, no other JRPG even comes close.
                One of the biggest problems reviewers commented on at the time was the lack of many good in-game tutorials - which is what I'm here to help you with!
                If you've never played this game before, or if you're looking to replay it after the disappointing year of new releases, or even if you just stumbled on this guide
                while browsing random games you've never heard of, what are you waiting for? Join me on a quest through Emberia, with this guide to make sure that you don't miss a single thing!
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we get into the main guide, there's a few things:<br><br>
                1) This guide is not spoiler-free. I'll avoid spoilers in the table of contents, and won't refer to important characters/enemies by name in the data lists,
                but each walkthrough section will assume you've already experienced the game up until that point. I'll put extra warning before major story spoilers, but they'll still be there, so be careful!<br><br>
                2) This guide won't (and can't!) tell you exactly how to win. This is explained in section 1.3 ("Building Characters") in more detail, but, to put it simply, each save file has
                a bunch of randomised factors that'll force you to build differently; sometimes very differently. I'll try to provide as much advice as possible, plus a big set of Q+As in section 5.2
                ("Building for Specific Situations") to point the way, but you'll often need to improvise, and will very likely get stuck on different things compared to other people.<br><br>
                3) If you have any suggestions or additional data for this guide, drop me an email at revinator2@gmail.com. I check them pretty frequently, but just mail me again if I don't respond in a week or so.<br><br>
                With that sorted, let's get into it!
